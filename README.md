Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
It is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems.
software engineering enables the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, including communication, commerce, entertainment, and healthcare.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Development of programming languages e.g Fortran in the 1050s
The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s
The advent of structured programming in the 1970s 
The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.



List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design - this is creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.



Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

While Waterfall follows a rigid, sequential process ,Agile is iterative and adapts to change.
Waterfall delivers a complete product at the end while agile delivers in small, functional increments.

Waterfall suits stable, well-defined projects e.g. medical software
Agile suits in evolving projects e.g. mobile apps.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A software developer is responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs are software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code e.g Visual Studio
VCS are software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members e.g Git 

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Changing Requirements leads to scope creep and delays - Use agile methods & clear stakeholder communication.
Tight Deadlines Can compromise quality. - Prioritize tasks, plan effectively, and use iterative releases.
Technical Debt Slows development & increases costs.  - Refactor code, follow best practices, and reassess goals regularly.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit this is testing individual components of software. This testing helps catch bugs early
Integration is the testing interactions between different components.This ensures proper communication and data flow between the components.
Sytem testing is testing the whole system as a whole.System testing ensures overall system reliability.
Acceptance testing is testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.This ensures user satisfaction.



#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. 
Prompt engineering helps avoid that by making your questions clear and specific, so the AI understands exactly what you need.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
vague prompt - tell me about cars
improved - tell about tesla electric cars and their costs
The improved prompt is more effective because it provides clear expectations.It also specifies the key aspects to ensure a relevant and precise answer.
